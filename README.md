# ESP32_Arduino_Hook_System

An Arduino project that performs the same operations as a toy catching automaton.

Toy Vending Machine

I. Introduction

The aim of our project is to create a system similar to toy vending machines. This system is an Arduino Esp32
It consists of microcontroller, stepper motors, cables and cardboard tape and glue.

II. Design Stages and Materials Used

A. Our Purpose and Features:
 - The main purpose of the toy vending machine is a machine that can be controlled from the phone via Bluetooth connection.
to create a mechanical system.
 - Used materials:
   1. 1pc Arduino Esp32 microcontroller
   2. 3 stepper motors
   3. Cables
   4. Cardboard, tape and glue for the machine's exoskeleton

B. Mechanical Structure:
 - Stepper motors; It is used to move in x, y and z axes.
 - Cardboard tape and glue were used to create the exoskeleton of the machine.

III. Working Principle

A. Bluetooth Connection:
 1. A connection is established from the phone via serial bluetooth terminal.
 2. Bluetooth connection is used to transmit commands from the phone to Arduino Esp32.

B. Mechanical Movement:
 1. Movement is controlled in x and y axes with right, left, forward and backward commands.
 2. The user can move the phone in any direction he wants.

C. Hook Operation:
 - A special command is used to run the hook when desired.

IV. Conclusions and Future Work

Our project has successfully formed the basis of a toy vending machine. However, the future
The system can be further improved by adding more features in the future. For example, automatic toy
User experience can be increased by adding additional features such as voice command selection and voice command detection.
